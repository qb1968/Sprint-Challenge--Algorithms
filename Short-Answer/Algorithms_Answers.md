Runtime Complexity = RC

## Exercise I

a) RC = 0(n)
   a increases by n^2during each loop 


b)RC = 0(nlogn)
Outer loop wil run n times and inner will run n log(n)
  


c)RC = O(n)
  It will recurse n times.

## Exercise II
RC = 0(logn)
Using binary search start on middle floor and drop egg. If egg breaks move to floors below and repeat, if egg does not break move to
floors above and repeat. This would use recursion.
